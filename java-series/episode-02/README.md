# Episode 2: Setup

Getting Java and IntelliJ IDEA set up. Once this is done, we can start coding!

## What We Did

- Installed JDK (Java Development Kit)
- Set up IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
- Wrote our first Java program

## The Code

`Main.java` - Classic "Hello, World!" program to verify everything works.

## Common Issues

If you see "java is not recognized":
- You didn't set JAVA_HOME during installation
- Reinstall JDK and make sure to check that option

If the code doesn't run:
- Make sure the class name matches the file name (Main.java = class Main)
- Don't forget the main method - Java needs it to run!
