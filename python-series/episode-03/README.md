# Episode 3: Variables & Data Types

Understanding how to store and work with different types of data.

## What We Learned

- Variables are like labeled boxes for storing data
- Different types: text (strings), numbers (int/float), true/false (bool)
- Converting between types when needed
- F-strings - the modern way to combine text and variables

## The Code

`main.py` has all the examples - variables, types, conversions, f-strings.

`project.py` is a simple program that collects user info and displays it.

## Key Takeaways

- Quotes make it text, no quotes = number
- Use f-strings instead of + for combining text
- Convert user input (always text) to numbers when needed
