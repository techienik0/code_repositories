# Episode 2: Setup

Getting Python and VS Code set up. This is the boring but necessary part!

## What We Did

- Installed Python (don't forget to check "Add to PATH"!)
- Set up VS Code with Python extension
- Wrote our first program

## The Code

`main.py` - Just prints "Hello, World!" to make sure everything works.

`test.py` - A quick test with variables to verify the setup is good.

## Common Issues

If you see "python is not recognized":
- You didn't add Python to PATH during installation
- Reinstall Python and check that box!

If print doesn't work:
- Make sure you're using Python 3, not Python 2
- Check the file ends in .py (not .txt)
- print is lowercase, not Print
