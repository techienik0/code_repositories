# Python → Data Science → AI → Machine Learning

Code repository for my Python learning series. All the code I write in the videos, organized by episode.

## What's Here

This repo has all the code from my 45-episode Python series:
- Episodes 1-10: Python basics (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
- Episodes 11-15: Intermediate stuff (OOP, modules, APIs)
- Episodes 16-22: Data handling (NumPy, Pandas, cleaning data)
- Episodes 23-26: Making charts and visualizations
- Episodes 27-35: Machine learning basics
- Episodes 36-45: Real projects (house prices, spam detection, etc.)

## How to Use

1. Pick an episode
2. Open the folder
3. Run `python main.py` to see the examples
4. Check `project.py` for the episode's project
5. Follow along with the YouTube video!

## Structure

Each episode has:
- `main.py` - All the code examples from that episode
- `project.py` - The project we build (if there is one)
- `README.md` - Quick summary of what we learned

## Episodes

- Episode 1: Why Python? (intro, no code)
- Episode 2: Setup
- Episode 3: Variables & Data Types
- Episode 4: If/Else Logic
- Episode 5: Loops
- Episode 6: Functions
- ... (more coming!)
