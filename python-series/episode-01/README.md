# Episode 1: Why Python?

Intro episode - why Python is everywhere in AI and data science.

## What We Covered

- Why companies like OpenAI, Google use Python for AI
- How Python compares to other languages
- What we'll build in this series (45 episodes!)

## Code Example

Showed a simple example to demonstrate Python's readability:

```python
def predict_price(house_size, location):
    if location == "downtown":
        return house_size * 500
    else:
        return house_size * 300
```

## Why Python?

- Super readable - almost like English
- Huge library ecosystem (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, etc.)
- Great community - help is always available
- Perfect for AI/ML because of the libraries
