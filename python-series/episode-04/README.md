# Episode 4: If/Else Logic

Making code that can make decisions. This is where it gets interesting!

## What We Learned

- if/else statements - make code do different things based on conditions
- Comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=)
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- elif for multiple conditions

## The Code

`main.py` - All the if/else examples

`project.py` - Grade calculator that determines letter grades based on scores

## Watch Out For

- Use `==` for comparison, not `=` (single = is for assigning values)
- Don't forget the colon `:` after the condition
- Indentation matters! The code inside if/else must be indented
