## 📖 Description

Learn to use loops to repeat code efficiently instead of copying and pasting.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Understand for loops and while loops
- Use the range() function
- Control loops with break and continue
- Build nested loops

## 💻 Code Examples

See `main.py` for all examples from this episode.

## 🎓 Project

See `project.py` for the Number Guessing Game project.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

2. Wrong indentation
3. Using range() incorrectly
4. Forgetting break/continue
